# Channels visualization
## Auto frequency heats
For those heats that are configured as auto frequency but they are not seeded yet, we show a *NC* as channel and judge.

And once the frequencies are assigned we show the frequency and assign a judge.

## Multiple video systems
As in [La Lligueta](https://lalligueta.com/) we want that as much people as possible has fun racing we accept multiple video systems:
- Analog
- DJI
- DJI O3
- Walksnail
- Walksnail Race
- HD Zero

Which results in a problem when saying to the pilots to which channel they have to configure their drones as some of this systems may call a channel by a different name, like you can see in the following picture

It's for this that in the judges tab you will see different namings for different video systems, this way we eliminate this problem. In the following picture you can see an example of all the systems.
